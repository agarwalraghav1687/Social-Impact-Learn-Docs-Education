# Social-Impact-Learn-Docs-Education

This team is focused on making existing content in Microsoft Docs more beginner/student friendly. The team is comprised of: Raksha Jain (Beta Ambassador), Jennifer Holland (Alpha Ambassador), Sathya Narayan (Gold Ambassador), and Raghav Agarwal (Alpha Ambassador). 

The team decided to focus on Microsoft Docs, and then spent a while researching and debating what area to focus on. We decided to focus on Visual Studio Code, as it was a topic that a lot of students would be using and we felt that some areas of it could be better explained for people who don't know a lot of technical terms and beginners to computer science.
