# Social-Impact-Learn-Docs-Education

This team is focused on making existing content in Microsoft Docs more beginner/student friendly. 
The team is comprised of: 
- Raksha Jain (Beta Ambassador)
- Jennifer Holland (Alpha Ambassador)
- P Sathya Narayan (Gold Ambassador)
- Raghav Agarwal (Alpha Ambassador)

The team decided to focus on Microsoft Docs, and then spent a while researching and debating what area to focus on. We decided to focus on Visual Studio Code, as it was a topic that a lot of students would be using and we felt that some areas of it could be better explained for people who don't know a lot of technical terms and beginners to computer science.
