# Research that we did!

The task that we were assigned was to **Bridge Content for MS Learn or Docs.**

We browsed through the various modules in MS Learn and found that it was already very beginner friendly and felt it does not require any more modification atleast on our end. 

So we decided to move towards the Docs.

We browsed through various topics in MS Docs and the one that excited us the most was **Visual Studio Code.**

<br>

# Why Visual Studio Code?

Visual Studio Code is a very powerful tool that we use to develop our code.

We tried going to the docs of Visual Studio Code and were not able to find a good documentation for various topics like how can we configure it according to our need, how we can install VS Code it in chromebooks,window, etc.

# VS Code for Chromebooks

**Chromebooks** are among the most popular devices among students for education because of the price and features they offer.

**Visual Studio Code** is among the most powerful and popular IDE available in the market with support to almost all programming languages.

When we go to Visual Studio Code website to [Download](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) it on Chromebook, we will find options to download it for various Operating Systems but **Not for ChromeOS**.

So, we went though the internet to find the resources for the same and we found a blog on VS Code website, but that blog was not much beginner friendly. It had things that might make people who are new to this not to go for it. 

So, we tried to create a simpler way to do the same.
