# Research that we did!

The task that we were assigned was to **Bridge Content for MS Learn or Docs.**

We browsed through the various modules in MS Learn and found that it was already very beginner friendly and felt it does not require any more modification atleast on our end. 

So we decided to move towards the Docs.

We browsed through various topics in MS Docs and the one that excited us the most was **Visual Studio Code.**

# Why Visual Studio Code?

Visual Studio Code is a very powerful tool that we use to develop our code.

We tried going to the docs of Visual Studio Code and were not able to find a good documentation for various topics like how can we configure it according to our need, how we can install VS Code it in chromebooks,window, etc.

# Installing VS Code in Windows

If students are downloading VS Code for the first time, they will probably be unaware of the technical jargon used in the installation process for Windows, e.g Adding to PATH.

My edits to the Windows Installation documentation step through the installation process and explain everything on each step to allow a student or beginner to install VS Code properly while being aware of what the options they select will change on their computer system.

# Introductory Videos

The Introductory Videos series for VS Code contain Video Outlines which are shown below each video. I added screenshots to these video outlines where applicable.

The videos are great, but if a student is looking for a direct answer quickly, they will most likely go to the video outline instead of watching a full video to get one answer. The outline can be made even easier to understand with screenshots, as this adds a visual explanation and helps show a new user of VS Code exactly where they should be looking to get what they want.

# VS Code for Chromebooks

**Chromebooks** are among the most popular devices among students for education because of the price and features they offer.

**Visual Studio Code** is among the most powerful and popular IDE available in the market with support to almost all programming languages.

When we go to Visual Studio Code website to [Download](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) it on Chromebook, we will find options to download it for various Operating Systems but **Not for ChromeOS**.

So, we went though the internet to find the resources for the same and we found a blog on VS Code website, but that blog was not much beginner friendly. It had things that might make people who are new to this not to go for it. 

So, we tried to create a simpler way to do the same.

# Configure compilers like C/C++ using MINGW
It is really a tedious process to configure and run source code written in programing languages like C/C++ in VSCode. So we come up with a simple and easy solution that will help many students across the globe in properly configuring and running C/C++ like source code in VSCode with just a click.
